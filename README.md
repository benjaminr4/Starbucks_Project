### Files Explanation
There are 4 jupyter notebooks used in this project:
* Dataset\_Exploration.ipynb - Demonstrates a lot of free form thinking and playing around with the data sets
* Data\_Preparation.ipynb - This is where the data sets were cleaned and the classes were defined
* Creating\_Model.ipynb - Shows the sklearn benchmark model being selected and all the various steps used to optimise it
* Creating\_Neural\_Network.ipynb - The neural network was created here using a lot of the information discovered in the refinement phase of the benchmark model 

The data sets used in this project are in the data file that was provided by Udacity

The data sets I created using the data sets provided:
* final_table.pkl (the initial result from cleaning and joining the data)
* final_table_nf.pkl (this table contains 'new features' I extracted so I could refine my models)
